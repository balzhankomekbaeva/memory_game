Functions
PostgreUser(config PostgreConfig) UserInfo
Creates a new PostgreSQL store instance (postgreStore) based on the given configuration.

GetUser(id int) (*User, error)
Fetches a user from the database by their unique ID.

GetByExternalID(externalID string) (*User, error)
Fetches a user based on an external identifier, such as a username or external system ID.

GetAllUser(filter UserFilter) ([]*User, error)
Retrieves all users, optionally ordered by score in descending order. You can limit the number of results using the filter.Limit parameter.

UpdateUser(id int, user *User) (*User, error)
Updates the specified user's data based on their ID.

DeleteUser(id int) error
Deletes a user from the database based on their ID.

CreateUser(user *User) (*User, error)
Creates a new user record in the database.

repository.go


The package enables interaction with a PostgreSQL database to manage user data through various CRUD operations. The UserInfo interface defines the core methods for user management, which are implemented by postgreStore.

Functions
PostgreUser(config PostgreConfig) UserInfo
Creates a new postgreStore instance based on the given configuration, allowing user operations through the UserInfo interface.

GetUser(id int) (*User, error)
Fetches a user from the database by their unique ID.

GetByExternalID(externalID string) (*User, error)
Fetches a user based on an external identifier, such as a username or external system ID.

GetAllUser(filter UserFilter) ([]*User, error)
Retrieves all users, ordered by score in descending order. The filter.Limit parameter can limit the number of results.

UpdateUser(id int, user *User) (*User, error)
Updates the specified user's data based on their ID.

DeleteUser(id int) error
Deletes a user from the database based on their ID.

CreateUser(user *User) (*User, error)
Creates a new user record in the database.


######################################### strategy.go

he t_bot package provides an interface, DifficultyStrategy, which defines the methods for setting board size and winning score for a game. Various difficulty levels, such as Easy, Medium, Hard, and Noob, implement this interface, allowing you to easily switch between them depending on game requirements.

Available Difficulty Levels
EasyDifficulty

Board Size: 3x4
Winning Score: 100
MediumDifficulty

Board Size: 4x4
Winning Score: 200
HardDifficulty

Board Size: 5x4
Winning Score: 300
NoobDifficulty

Board Size: 2x2
Winning Score: 1


#########################################
game.go

The main struct that holds the game state, board configuration, revealed cells, and current score.

showBoard(): Displays the current state of the board, showing matched emojis and hiding unmatched ones.
startGame(): Handles game logic, including emoji matching, message handling, and score updates.

#########################################
observer.go

mplements the Observer and Observable interfaces for notifying observers about game events.

AddObserver(), RemoveObserver(), NotifyObservers(): Allow the game to manage and notify observers of changes.


#########################################

game_factory.go

Creates new game instances with random emoji placements based on difficulty level.

NewGame(strategy DifficultyStrategy): Instantiates a game with a specific board configuration based on difficulty.

#########################################
User Management

Defines user-related structs and functions for tracking user information and scores.

User struct: Represents individual users with fields for ID, name, username, and score.
updateUserScore(): Updates or creates user records in the repository based on their performance.

This is a Telegram bot implemented in Go that serves as a memory game and location-checking tool. The bot allows users to start new games with varying difficulty levels, view personal and global scores, check locations for safety, and manage user history. Itâ€™s built using the [Telebot library](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/tucnak/telebot.v2) and follows a Factory design pattern for modular command and game creation.

## Features

- Memory Game: Users can start new games at different difficulty levels (Noob, Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Location Management: The bot allows users to save, view, and delete their home location and check it for safety.
- Crime Search: Users can search for recent crime events around their saved locations.
- History Tracking: The bot saves a history of user actions, allowing users to view and clear their past interactions.
- Rating System: Displays global top 10 players and personal scores.

## Project Structure

- t_bot: Core bot logic, commands, and game mechanics.
- UserInfo: Interface defining user-related database operations (e.g., saving scores, retrieving history).
- DefaultGameFactory: Factory pattern class responsible for creating new game instances based on difficulty levels.
- fromGRPCErr: Helper function to convert gRPC errors into user-friendly messages.
